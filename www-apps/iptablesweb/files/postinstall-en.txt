STEP 1:
it's recommended to switch "register_globals" to "Off" to increase security


STEP 2:
First of all, it is necessary to modify the ulogd conf file (in mandrake is in /etc/ulogd.conf) to write
the log on database (MySQL). 
(For further information go to http://www.netfilter.org/projects/ulogd/downloads.html)

//example of ulogd file

mysqltable ulog
mysqlpass password
mysqluser user
mysqldb iptables
mysqlhost localhost
# load the plugin (remove the ' # ' if you want to enable it)
plugin/usr/lib/ulogd/ulogd_MYSQL.so


After this step you must execute ulogd service (in mandrake with "ulogd - d");  if you haven't found any
problem, you can define the new iptables rules.

//example of iptables rules

/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ULOG --ulog-prefix "ICMP DROP"
/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -m state --state INVALID -j ULOG --ulog-prefix "INVALID"
/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp ! --syn -m state --state NEW -j ULOG --ulog-prefix "NEW INCORRECT"
/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1:1024 -m state --state NEW -j ULOG --ulog-prefix "TCP DROP"
/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 1:1024 -m state --state NEW -j ULOG --ulog-prefix "UDP DROP"

The first rule records "echo-request" with the name "ICMP DROP"
The second rule records invalid packets with the name "INVALID"
The third rule records "new connections" that don't start with SYN packet with the name "NEW INCORRECT"
The fourth rule records the TCP connection, from port number 1 to 1024, with the name "TCP DROP"
The fifth rule records the UDP connection, from port number 1 to 1024, with the name "UDP DROP"



STEP 3:
Browse http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/install.php

During the installation you must:

* define the General configuration:
        Public access: it permits if the web has public access or not
        Default language: default language of system
        System url: link of IptablesWeb (can be http or https) 
	(e.g. http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/my_iptablesweb/)
        System email: system email of IptablesWeb
        Absolute path: absolute path of system
        Crontab password: password to protect system script (used for statistic update)
        Log saved: Log saved for each user

* define Database configuration:
        Database: Type of database used
        Host database: Host address where the database is reachable
        Database name: Database name
        Username: Username
        Password: Password
        Ulogd table: ulogd table used to save iptables log

* define Session configuration:
        Garbage collector time (in second): Garbace collector time
        Session time (in second): Session validity time, in second; if 0, session will last until the
browser is close

* define Email configuration:
        Type of SMTP: if you want use internal smtp, use localhost otherwise an external one
        SMTP server: external SMTP server
        Authentication: Use this features if you wish to send email with authentication
        Username: Username of server SMTP authentication
        Password: Password of server SMTP authentication

Remember that IptablesWeb tables must be in the same database where ulogd tables exists.

Finally you must define the first group and the first admin account. 
REMEMBER TO "chmod 777 ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}/tmp/"
DELETE ${VHOST_ROOT}/${PN}/install.php.



STEP 4:
Now you must define what type of iptables log must be managed; go to Iptables management.

//example of iptables rule

/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ULOG --ulog-prefix "ICMP DROP"

In the name field write the string ICMP DROP; in the color field write a SRGB color (e.g. #FF0000 for the
red); in the name field write a text that will be displayed in the IptablesWeb interfaces.

Then go to System info area and you will be found the link to copy in your event schedulator, like
crontab.

In crontab you must paste this link
*/5 * * * * lynx > /dev/null -dump http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}//system.php?key_check=cc03e047a6afgbcbk8be7668acfebae5


STEP 5:
First of all you must  download a plugin and then decompress it. Now copy the folder you just extracted
into the "plugin" folder of your IptablesWeb.
Go to your administrative area, select plugin management and click on the icon to install it.
Go to Block management to duplicate the plugin.

Remember, a block can be created if:
        A plugin is selected
        An Iptables rule is selected
        A group is selected or/and a block is defined public
        All mandatory fields are used

A block will be displayed when the user activates the block into block management area.
